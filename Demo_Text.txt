Hermes is a Greek Olympian, god. Born to Zeus and Maya, Hermes is known for his quick thinking and cunning nature. He is the youngest of the Olympians and known for moving quickly between the divine and mortal worlds. Because of this power, Hermes often acted as a messenger between the men and the Olympians. A benevolent god, Hermes protects travellers and athletes. He is also known as mischievous as he often plays tricks on other gods. He does this for his own amusement or to save people from the wrath of the gods. Hermes is also the fastest of all the gods because he has wings with his sandals. Interestingly, even when Hermes was a child he could not resist the urge to steal. Therefore, he is also credited as the patron god of all thieves.
